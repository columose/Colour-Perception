# Colour-Perception
I'll be adding some content to this repository related to my Master's thesis project, where we conducted psychophysics and EEG experiments to investigate the contribution of colour-opponent mechanisms to surface perception.

The [poster](Thesis/Colour_perception_poster.pdf) provides a refined version of the thesis. I also did some additional analyses and plotted the power spectrum from 1 to 22Hz. It was unexpected, but we found a clear peak at 10Hz, which couldn't have been a harmonic to our frequency tagging. This peak possibly (probably in my opinion) reflects the average 'individual alpha frequency' of our subjects.

Noteworthy is the fact that alpha peak power is substantially lower for illusory stimuli (figure 7a) - consistent with the attentional demands of perceptual filling-in. That said, a follow-up experiment should consider presenting the stimuli in a more classical trial structure: 500ms delay, present stimulus, wait for 1 second to allow the ERP to develop. Then we could look into the alpha band without contamination from the frequency-tagged ERPs.


Otherwise, the EEG experiment was a success! We show that illusory colour evokes a cortical 'spreading-out' response during 'filling-in'.
